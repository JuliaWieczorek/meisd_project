320,Easy boy. What do you expect? They're savages. I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I never seen a thing like this not ever in my life. Close as any man would.,3
321,Where is he?,1
322,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on. Run.,3
323,And they can kill.,1
324,You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls. I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.,2
325,And of course you have also heard the phrase a Lannister always pays his debts. If you deliver a message from me... to Lady Arryn I will be in your debt.,3
326,Ned! It's Robert. We were hunting... a boar...,2
327,Now if you'll pardon me I'll seek out the merchant captain,1
328,If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey... You would never be allowed to leave. No. is that you can defeat them in the field.,3
329,We need to get him on broken ground put his knights at a disadvantage. No we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun. The late Lord Frey my father calls him.,2
330,She ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough while I wrapped her in my cloak.,2
331,Rickon! That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!,3
332,Ser Meryn.,1
333,I can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time when you were young? What does it say?,2
334,You can't! Get out of my way Sam. They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens.,3
335,The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse. Your Grace the Lannisters are the true enemy. I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king.,1
336,Come here! Yoren said none of us were to go near those three. Come here! They don't scare me.,3
337,You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me... Keep your voice down.,2
338,What is the meaning of this? No please please. You disappoint me Grand Maester. l am your loyal servant.,3
339,BOLTON: Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. MAN: They're dead. Take everything they've got. BOLTON: We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own. We're not executing prisoners Lord Bolton. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans. l doubt it.,2
340,We'll leave him to it. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now.,2
341,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing. Stannis will be here any day.,2
342,MAN 1 0: Loose! MAN 1 1 : Put your backs into it!,1
343,Share the weight with me. He wasn't your brother.,3
344,I heard you were dead. I had hoped to speak to you alone Your Grace. We are alone.,1
345,RICKARD: We're at war. This march is a distraction. BB: My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.,2
346,Keep quiet.,2
347,My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father. I was just thinking how jealous I was,2
348,Half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye. 20000 head of cattle. 50000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them. As is a royal wedding.,2
349,Do you think people will like it? You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway from what I can tell the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.,2
350,What you need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming. No. No you're just gonna light the biggest fire,2
351,Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock. And I'm Shae the funny whore. My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.,2
352,That thought had crossed my mind yeah. There are no mistakes.,1
353,Yes well it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope...,2
354,I have come to make my apologies my lord and to beg your forgiveness. Don't beg my forgiveness Your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls. One of them was supposed to be queen.,2
355,The late Walder Frey old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. You're dead your daughter's dead your grandson's dead,2
356,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died. I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep. Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body?,3
357,They say a thousand slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen. And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. If they're smart Your Grace.,1
358,I'm not afraid. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life? I need you to leave.,2
359,So am I the queen? More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. This would not be an opportune moment to press the issue. Clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make it stop... It was horrible.,2
361,You could set me free. You know I can't. Then there's really nothing else to say. What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,2
362,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive,2
363,I did too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?,3
364,Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial? We had a good thing here.,3
365,Go left. Theon Greyjoy. I don't know... I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons. He's not in the dungeons. Last cage on the right. Thank you.,3
366,MERYN: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.,2
367,I hope I didn't frighten you. Do you remember the name you were given at birth?,2
368,We need more men down here. We have to hold the gate. But we need men here. Tell Jon. He's in command. Let's go. Get me to the top! You hear me?,3
369,You think he'll just accept that? I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.,1
370,The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. But I'm your squire. Do you even know what a squire is?,2
371,Podrick! Guard ♪2: Hold on to her! Take her! Guard ♪3: Keep moving! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!,3
372,I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants.,2
373,Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital's not for everyone I suppose.,1
374,As punishment for both of you. It didn't seem that way.,2
375,I don't think Stannis would like that very much. I can't.,2
376,I saw you staring at her. That will involve looking at her from time to time. You said you'd marry me. And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow.,3
377,The weather has already begun to turn. That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds. My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.,3
378,Yes I swear it.,1
379,My beautiful wife. When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat bearded beast.,2
380,Derek: Killed a white walker eh? You fat-ass fuck. Come on get up. Gilly: No! This your hero? This hog? Leave him alone! Stubborn little wildling bitch aren't you?,3
381,Get him out of my sight.,3
383,He died. I put an arrow through his heart. Tormund: Hey hey. Hey hey hey hey hey.,1
386,Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.,2
387,Try not to lose it this time. Do you think Mother will like him? I'm not so sure about that.,2
388,DORAN: I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive. And men.,2
389,I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared. How'd she look? She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady. What happened at Winterfell? I should have gone with you while I had the chance.,3
390,Lord take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.,1
391,I don't think you could ride the dragon. Twenty years ago maybe. Makes me sad.,2
392,I agree. You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts and take her back into Crown custody.,1
393,MAN: No! No! No! It was you.,3
394,We've never had a queen. Not once. There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind,3
395,JON: We can't defend the North from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive we need Winterfell and to take Winterfell we need more men. The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.,3
396,What about your mother and sister?,2
397,Everything all right? Nobody yet. So we ride for Meereenand after that we sail for Westeros. I take what is mine. You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.,1
398,Why would he abandon his ancestral home? Have you ever met the Blackfish? No. He's even more stubborn than you are.,1
399,Oh I see. You're a madman. I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong... Don't talk about Cat! I'll talk about whomever I want. She loved her children.,3
400,RAZDAL: Once before I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.,1
401,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell yes? You were making jokes about my heightI seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. The height of nobility ""a man of your stature""",1
402,I'm not a Stark. You are to me. He did. And you trust him?,2
403,What is this? It's what Father trained us for whether he knew it or not.,2
404,Should we send word to your family Ser...,3
405,You don't believe him. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?,1
406,You're too hard on yourself my lady.,1
407,JAIME: We don't have time for this. The Dothraki are coming. BRONN: All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.,1
408,So what's the point in serving a god if none of us knows what he wants?,1
409,are we being punished for something? - no,2
410,"yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to the roof what are you gonna do? nothing. it's a game. i gotta just",2

416,"it's true. i can hear them. what's that, little boys? what's that? party number two, not so good. - no, let's go back to party number one no, no turning back. ranjit, party number three",2
417,"unless... - no, no unless",1
418,"so, one more week and it'll be a month oh, come on! the 18th can't get here fast enough",2
419,"well, that's just crazy okay so it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you, it's crazy but you have a job here and a life. i'd have nothing there",2
420,miss me?,2
421,"oh, yes, you do. - attractive, college-educated",1
422,"so, i wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in san francisco no. no, no good can come from looking at this",3

437,"oh, come on! we agreed did marshall take his pants off? this is wimbledon, ted",2
